    "String Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "String indexing allows you to access individual characters in a string. You can do this by using square brackets and the location, or index, of the character you want to access. It's important to remember that Python starts indexes at 0. So to access the first character in a string, you would use the index [0]. If you try to access an index that’s larger than the length of your string, you’ll get an IndexError. This is because you’re trying to access something that doesn't exist! You can also access indexes from the end of the string going towards the start of the string by using negative values. The index [-1] would access the last character of the string, and the index [-2] would access the second-to-last character.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access a portion of a string, called a slice or a substring. This allows you to access multiple characters of a string. You can do this by creating a range, using a colon as a separator between the start and end of the range, like [2:5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "This range is similar to the range() function we saw previously. It includes the first number, but goes to one less than the last number. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> fruit = \"Mangosteen\"\n",
    ">>> fruit[1:4]\n",
    "'ang'\n",
    "\n",
    "The slice includes the character at index 1, and excludes the character at index 4. You can also easily reference a substring at the start or end of the string by only specifying one end of the range. For example, only giving the end of the range:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> fruit[:5]\n",

    "Basic String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, strings are immutable. This means that they can't be modified. So if we wanted to fix a typo in a string, we can't simply modify the wrong character. We would have to create a new string with the typo corrected. We can also assign a new value to the variable holding our string.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we aren't sure what the index of our typo is, we can use the string method index to locate it and return the index. Let's imagine we have the string \"lions tigers and bears\" in the variable animals. We can locate the index that contains the letter g using animals.index(\"g\"), which will return the index; in this case 8. We can also use substrings to locate the index where the substring begins. animals.index(\"bears\") would return 17, since that’s the start of the substring. If there’s more than one match for a substring, the index method will return the first match. If we try to locate a substring that doesn't exist in the string, we’ll receive a ValueError explaining that the substring was not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can avoid a ValueError by first checking if the substring exists in the string. This can be done using the in keyword. We saw this keyword earlier when we covered for loops. In this case, it's a conditional that will be either True or False. If the substring is found in the string, it will be True. If the substring is not found in the string, it will be False. Using our previous variable animals, we can do \"horses\" in animals to check if the substring \"horses\" is found in our variable. In this case, it would evaluate to False, since horses aren’t included in our example string. If we did \"tigers\" in animals, we'd get True, since this substring is contained in our string."

    "Advanced String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We've covered a bunch of String class methods already, so let's keep building on those and run down some more advanced methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The string method **lower** will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. The inverse of this is the **upper** method, which will return the string all in uppercase. Just like with previous methods, we call these on a string using dot notation, like **\"this is a string\".upper()**. This would return the string **\"THIS IS A STRING\"**. This can be super handy when checking user input, since someone might type in all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the **strip** method to remove surrounding whitespace from a string. Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newline characters. You can also use the methods  **lstrip** and **rstrip** to remove whitespace only from the left or the right side of the string, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method **count** can be used to return the number of times a substring appears in a string. This can be handy for finding out how many characters appear in a string, or counting the number of times a certain word appears in a sentence or paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to check if a string ends with a given substring, you can use the method **endswith**. This will return True if the substring is found at the end of the string, and False if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **isnumeric** method can check if a string is composed of only numbers. If the string contains only numbers, this method will return True. We can use this to check if a string contains numbers before passing the string to the **int()** function to convert it to an integer, avoiding an error. Useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "We took a look at string concatenation using the plus sign, earlier. We can also use the **join** method to concatenate strings. This method is called on a string that will be used to join a list of strings. The method takes a list of strings to be joined as a parameter, and returns a new string composed of each of the strings from our list joined using the initial string. For example, **\" \".join([\"This\",\"is\",\"a\",\"sentence\"])** would return the string **\"This is a sentence\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of the join method is the **split** method. This allows us to split a string into a list of strings. By default, it splits by any whitespace characters. You can also split by any other characters by passing a parameter."

To do this, create a string containing curly brackets, **{}**, as a placeholder, to be replaced. Then call the format method on the string using .format() and pass variables as parameters. The variables passed to the method will then be used to replace the curly bracket placeholders. This method automatically handles any conversion between data types for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the curly brackets are empty, they’ll be populated with the variables passed in the order in which they're passed. However, you can put certain expressions inside the curly brackets to do even more powerful string formatting operations. You can put the name of a variable into the curly brackets, then use the names in the parameters. This allows for more easily readable code, and for more flexibility with the order of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also put a formatting expression inside the curly brackets, which lets you alter the way the string is formatted. For example, the formatting expression **{:.2f}** means that you’d format this as a float number, with two digits after the decimal dot. The colon acts as a separator from the field name, if you had specified one. You can also specify text alignment using the greater than operator: **>**. For example, the expression **{:>3.2f}** would align the text three spaces to the right, as well as specify a float number with two decimal places. String formatting can be very handy for outputting easy-to-read textual output."

    "Lists in Python are defined using square brackets, with the elements stored in the list separated by commas: ```list = [\"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"list\"]```. You can use the len() function to return the number of elements in a list: len(list) would return 4. You can also use the in keyword to check if a list contains a certain element. If the element is present, it will return a True boolean. If the element is not found in the list, it will return False. For example, \"This\" in list would return True in our example. Similar to strings, lists can also use indexing to access specific elements in a list based on their position. You can access the first element in a list by doing list[0], which would allow you to access the string \"This\".\n",

Sequences have similar properties, like (1) being able to iterate over them using for loops; (2) support indexing; (3) using the len function to find the length of the sequence; (4) using the plus operator + in order to concatenate; and (5) using the in keyword to check if the sequence contains a value.

    "\n",
    "While lists and strings are both sequences, a big difference between them is that lists are mutable. This means that the contents of the list can be changed, unlike strings, which are immutable. You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add elements to the end of a list using the *append* method. You call this method on a list using dot notation, and pass in the element to be added as a parameter. For example, *list.append(\"New data\")* would add the string \"New data\" to the end of the list called list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add an element to a list in a specific position, you can use the method *insert*. The method takes two parameters: the first specifies the index in the list, and the second is the element to be added to the list. So *list.insert(0, \"New data\")* would add the string \"New data\" to the front of the list. This wouldn't overwrite the existing element at the start of the list. It would just shift all the other elements by one. If you specify an index that’s larger than the length of the list, the element will simply be added to the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can remove elements from the list using the *remove* method. This method takes an element as a parameter, and removes the first occurrence of the element. If the element isn’t found in the list, you’ll get a *ValueError* error explaining that the element was not found in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also remove elements from a list using the *pop* method. This method differs from the remove method in that it takes an index as a parameter, and returns the element that was removed. This can be useful if you don't know what the value is, but you know where it’s located. This can also be useful when you need to access the data and also want to remove it from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can change an element in a list by using indexing to overwrite the value stored at the specified index. For example, you can enter list[0] = \"Old data\" to overwrite the first element in a list with the new string \"Old data\"."

    "# Tuples\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, strings and lists are both examples of sequences. Strings are sequences of characters, and are immutable. Lists are sequences of elements of any data type, and are mutable. The third sequence type is the tuple. Tuples are like lists, since they can contain elements of any data type. But unlike lists, tuples are immutable. They’re specified using parentheses instead of square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why tuples are a thing, given how similar they are to lists. Tuples can be useful when we need to ensure that an element is in a certain position and will not change. Since lists are mutable, the order of the elements can be changed on us. Since the order of the elements in a tuple can't be changed, the position of the element in a tuple can have meaning. A good example of this is when a function returns multiple values. In this case, what gets returned is a tuple, with the return values as elements in the tuple. The order of the returned values is important, and a tuple ensures that the order isn’t going to change. Storing the elements of a tuple in separate variables is called unpacking. This allows you to take multiple returned values from a function and store each value in its own variable."

    "## Dictionaries Defined\n",
    "Dictionaries are another data structure in Python. They’re similar to a list in that they can be used to organize data into collections. However, data in a dictionary isn't accessed based on its position. Data in a dictionary is organized into pairs of keys and values. You use the key to access the corresponding value. Where a list index is always a number, a dictionary key can be a different data type, like a string, integer, float, or even tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a dictionary, you use curly brackets: **{}**. When storing values in a dictionary, the key is specified first, followed by the corresponding value, separated by a colon. For example, **animals = { \"bears\":10, \"lions\":1, \"tigers\":2 }** creates a dictionary with three key value pairs, stored in the variable animals. The key \"bears\" points to the integer value 10, while the key \"lions\" points to the integer value 1, and \"tigers\" points to the integer 2. You can access the values by referencing the key, like this: **animals[\"bears\"]**. This would return the integer 10, since that’s the corresponding value for this key.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also check if a key is contained in a dictionary using the **in** keyword. Just like other uses of this keyword, it will return True if the key is found in the dictionary; otherwise it will return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be modified by adding, removing, and replacing elements in a dictionary, similar to lists. You can add a new key value pair to a dictionary by assigning a value to the key, like this: **animals[\"zebras\"] = 2**. This creates the new key in the animal dictionary called zebras, and stores the value 2. You can modify the value of an existing key by doing the same thing. So **animals[\"bears\"] = 11** would change the value stored in the bears key from 10 to 11. Lastly, you can remove elements from a dictionary by using the **del** keyword. By doing **del animals[\"lions\"]** you would remove the key value pair from the animals dictionary."
