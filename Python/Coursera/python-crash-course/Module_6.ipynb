    "Before processing any text, you need to remove all the punctuation marks. To do this, you can go through each line of text, character-by-character, using the **isalpha()** method. This will check whether or not the character is a letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To split a line of text into words, you can use the **split()** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before storing words in the frequency dictionary, check if theyâ€™re part of the \"uninteresting\" set of words (for example: \"a\", \"the\", \"to\", \"if\"). Make this set a parameter to your function so that you can change it if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input file\n",
    "For the input file, you need to provide a file that contains text only. For the text itself, you can copy and paste the contents of a website you like. Or you can use a site like [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) to find books that are available online. You could see what word clouds you can get from famous books, like a Shakespeare play or a novel by Jane Austen.\n",
