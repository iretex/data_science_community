Below is an example of an Apple class with a constructor method defined.\n",

You might remember that special methods start and end with two underscore characters. In our example above, the constructor method takes the self variable, which represents the instance, as well as color and flavor parameters. These parameters are then used by the constructor method to set the values for the current instance. So we can now create a new instance of the Apple class and set the color and flavor values all in go:\n",

If an object doesn’t have this special method defined, it will wind up using the default representation, which will print the position of the object in memory. Not super useful. Here is our Apple class, with the __str__ method added:\n",

    "Inheritance allows us to define attributes or methods that are shared by all types of fruit without having to define them in each fruit class individually.

There is also the speak method, which will print the name of the animal along with the sound it makes. We defined the Piglet and Cow classes, which inherit from the Animal class, and we set the sound attributes for each animal type.

    "You can have a situation where two different classes are related, but there is no inheritance going on. This is referred to as composition -- where one class makes use of code contained in another class. For example, imagine we have a Package class which represents a software package. It contains attributes about the software package, like name, version, and size. We also have a Repository class which represents all the packages available for installation. While there’s no inheritance relationship between the two classes, they are related. The Repository class will contain a dictionary or list of Packages that are contained in the repository. Let's take a look at an example Repository class definition:\n",

    "```\n",

    "In the constructor method, we initialize the packages dictionary, which will contain the package objects available in this repository instance. We initialize the dictionary in the constructor to ensure that every instance of the Repository class has its own dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define the add_package method, which takes a Package object as a parameter, and then adds it to our dictionary, using the package name attribute as the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we define a total_size method which computes the total size of all packages contained in our repository. This method iterates through the values in our repository dictionary and adds together the size attributes from each package object contained in the dictionary, returning the total at the end. In this example, we’re making use of Package attributes within our Repository class. We’re also calling the values() method on our packages dictionary instance. Composition allows us to use objects as attributes, as well as access all their attributes and methods."

    "Python modules are separate files that contain classes, functions, and other data that allow us to import and make use of these methods and classes in our own code. Python comes with a lot of modules out of the box. These modules are referred to as the Python Standard Library. You can make use of these modules by using the import keyword, followed by the module name. For example, we'll import the random module, and then call the randint function within this module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dotnetcli\n",
    ">>> import random\n",
    ">>> random.randint(1,10)\n",

    ">>> random.randint(1,10)\n",
    "1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes two integer parameters and returns a random integer between the values we pass it; in this case, 1 and 10. You might notice that calling functions in a module is very similar to calling methods in a class. We use dot notation here too, with a period between the module and function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at another module: datetime. This module is super helpful when working with dates and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> import datetime\n",
    ">>> now = datetime.datetime.now()\n",

    ">>> print(now)\n",
    "2019-04-24 16:54:55.155199\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    ">>> print(now)\n",

    "2019-05-22 16:54:55.155199\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we call the print function with an instance of the datetime class, we get the date and time printed in a specific format. This is because the datetime class has a __str__ method defined which generates the formatted string we see here. We can also directly call attributes and methods of the class, as with now.year which returns the year attribute of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we can access other classes contained in the datetime module, like the timedelta class. In this example, we’re creating an instance of the timedelta class with the parameter of 28 days. We’re then adding this object to our instance of the datetime class from earlier and printing the result. This has the effect of adding 28 days to our original datetime object."
