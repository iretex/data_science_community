RECAP

Each of the sections has been labeled to assist if you need to revisit a particular topic. Intentionally, the solutions for a particular section are actually not in the labeled section, because my hope is this will force you to practice if you have a question about a particular topic we covered.

You have now gained a ton of useful skills associated with SQL. The combination of JOINs and Aggregations is one of the reasons SQL is such a powerful tool.

If there was a particular topic you struggled with, I suggest coming back and revisiting the questions with a fresh mind. The more you practice the better, but you also don't want to get stuck on the same problem for an extended period of time!

In this lesson, we covered and you can now:
- Deal with NULL values
- Create aggregations in your SQL Queries including
    - COUNT
    - SUM
    - MIN & MAX
    - AVG
    - GROUP BY
    - DISTINCT
    - HAVING
- Create DATE functions
- Implement CASE statements

GROUP BY	Used to aggregate data within subsets of the data. For example, grouping for different accounts, different regions, or different sales representatives.
HAVING	is the “clean” way to filter a query that has been aggregated
NULLs	A datatype that specifies where no data exists in SQL
